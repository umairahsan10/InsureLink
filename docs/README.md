# InsureLink Documentation

## Purpose
This folder stores meeting notes and decisions to track the evolving requirements and priorities for the FYP project.

## Structure
- One markdown file per meeting/decision session
- Files named by date: `YYYY-MM-DD-meeting.md`
- Keep content minimal and focused on what was decided, not implementation details

## Usage
Team members working on features can refer to these files to understand:
- What features need to be built
- What priorities were set
- What decisions were made

Implementation details are left for the developer working on each feature to figure out.

## File Naming
Use format: `YYYY-MM-DD-short-description.md`
Examples:
- `2025-11-01-meeting.md`
- `2025-10-25-supervisor.md`
- `2025-11-05-pak-qatar.md`
