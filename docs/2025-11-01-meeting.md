# Meeting Notes - November 1, 2025

## Attendees
Supervisor, Project Team

## Context
Preparing frontend demo for Pak-Qatar insurance company meeting. Focus on demonstrating complete claim cycle.

## New Information
- Hospital-Insurance billing done at end of month, committed at patient discharge
- Patient-Hospital billing done on-spot before discharge in Pakistan
- Unread messages >X hours should trigger reminder email (UI indication for now)

## Priorities Set

### Priority 1: Core Data Management
**Bulk Employee Upload**
- Corporate portal: CSV file upload for adding multiple employees at once
- Client-side CSV parser to extract employee data
- Validate data format and required fields
- Show preview before confirming batch addition

**Dependent Management**
- Corporate: Add dependents (spouse, children, parents) for employees
- Corporate: Approve/reject employee requests to add new dependents
- Employee: View own dependents (read-only)
- Employee: Create request to add new dependent
- Insurance: View approved dependents linked to employee profiles

### Priority 2: Hospital-Insurance Communication
**Claim-Based Messaging System**
- Hospital & Insurance portals: Add messaging button to claims tables
- Open chat interface per claim showing message thread
- Allow text messages and document attachments
- Display unread message indicators/badges
- Show visual alert if messages unread for >X hours

### Priority 3: Simple UI Enhancements
**Emergency Contact Display**
- Research standard escalation hierarchy (Coordinator → Manager → Director → CEO)
- Display emergency contacts on all dashboards with name, role, phone, email
- Show escalation path for each role

**Automated Alert UI**
- Display notification banners for: high-value claims (>limit), policies near expiry, pending dependent requests, old unread messages
- Different severity levels (info, warning, critical)
- Dismissible alerts

### Priority 4: Remaining Features (Doable Without Backend)
- **Activity Log**: Display claim events timeline with actor, role, action, timestamp (data already in claims.json)
- **Enhanced Forms**: Research actual Pakistan insurance forms and replicate for hospital claim creation, document upload, insurance review/approval
- **Smart Hospital Finder**: Use browser Geolocation API to find nearest in-network hospitals, integrate Google Maps for navigation

### End Goal: Complete Claim Cycle Demo
Multi-dashboard simulation showing full workflow:
1. Patient submits claim
2. Hospital views claim → uploads documents → messages insurance
3. Insurance reviews → requests more info via message
4. Hospital sees notification → replies with additional docs
5. Insurance approves with amount → closes claim
6. Patient sees updated "Approved" status

**Implementation**: Use localStorage/sessionStorage to share data between portals across multiple browser tabs.

### Features Requiring Backend (FYP-2)
- **AI-Assisted Claim Validation**: Use ML model to validate claims (e.g., medicine matches diagnosis)
- **Fraud Detection**: Analyze patterns to identify duplicate or suspicious claims across system
- **Automated Email/SMS Alerts**: Send actual emails/SMS notifications (reminders for unread messages, policy expiry, etc.)
- **Real-time Notifications**: WebSocket server for live updates across portals
- **Data Persistence**: Database to store all data permanently (currently resets on page refresh)
- **Mobile Application**: Native or hybrid mobile app development (separate project)
